Ramadan Tek is a time-bound economic framework inspired by the principles of Ramadan:

Restraint.  
Redistribution.  
Renewal.

It encodes discipline and collective alignment into a 30-day parameter cycle.

This is not a permanent mode.
It is a defined period of intentional reduction followed by structured renewal.

## Core Thesis

Ramadan is built on:

- Fasting (self-restraint)
- Zakat (redistribution)
- Reflection (intention over impulse)
- Community (shared participation)
- Eid (renewal after discipline)

Ramadan Tek mirrors these principles mechanically.

---

## Mechanism Overview

During the 30-day Ramadan cycle, the system shifts into:

1) Reduced emissions
2) Slower mechanical reflexes
3) Structured redistribution
4) Anti-speculation bias
5) Controlled renewal at cycle end

The objective is not price acceleration.
The objective is structural strengthening.

# Zakat Model

Inspired by traditional Zakat (commonly 2.5% of qualifying wealth),
Ramadan Tek introduces a structured redistribution model.

## Zakat Allocation (Example Model)

During Ramadan period:

- 2.5% of protocol fee flow is allocated to the **Zakat Pool**
- The Zakat Pool is distributed to:
  - Long-term holders (time-weighted)
  - Community development wallets
  - Public-good integrations (if applicable)

Alternative configuration:
- 2.5% base allocation
- Up to 5% dynamic allocation during high-activity days

The Zakat Pool is:
- Transparent
- Time-bound
- Automatically executed
- Non-discretionary

Redistribution is mechanical, not emotional.

# 30-Day Ramadan Parameter Schedule

Ramadan Tek runs on a structured timeline.

## Days 1–7: Entry Phase (Adjustment)

- Emissions reduced by 20%
- Buyback cadence slowed
- Zakat Pool activated (2.5%)
- Speculative incentives reduced

Goal: stabilize and establish discipline.

---

## Days 8–20: Deep Restraint Phase

- Emissions reduced by 40%
- Buybacks operate on TWAP (slower execution)
- Zakat allocation active
- Short-term trading rewards minimized
- Long-term holder weighting increases

Goal: strengthen core holders and reduce noise.

---

## Days 21–29: Reflection Phase

- Emissions reduced by 50%
- Buybacks limited and selective
- Zakat allocation may increase on high-fee days
- Defensive mechanics active (volatility throttling)

Goal: reinforce stability before renewal.

---

## Day 30: Renewal (Eid Transition)

- Emissions restored gradually
- Buyback cadence normalized
- Burn ratio optionally increased temporarily
- Redistribution snapshot finalized
- System exits Ramadan Mode

Goal: transition into strength.

# Anti-Speculation Logic

Ramadan Tek discourages impulsive churn during the cycle:

- Cooldown periods for rapid trading
- Reduced short-term multipliers
- Time-weighted holding metrics
- Fee sensitivity adjustments

Patience is rewarded.
Excess is softened.

---

# Design Principles

- Time-bound discipline
- Transparent redistribution
- Mechanical execution
- Community alignment
- Renewal after restraint

This is not austerity.
It is structured intention.

# Status

Ramadan Tek is a cyclical economic mode.

It activates during the Ramadan period
and exits after renewal.

All parameters are configurable but constrained.

---

# Closing

Ramadan teaches restraint before reward.

Ramadan Tek encodes that principle.

Discipline first.
Renewal second.
